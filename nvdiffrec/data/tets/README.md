Place the tet grid files in this folder. 
We provide a few example grids. See the main README.md for a download link.

You can also generate your own grids using [quartet](https://github.com/crawforddoran/quartet).
Please see the `generate_tets.py` script for an example. 
Remember to renormalize the generated tet grid to [-0.5, 0.5].
